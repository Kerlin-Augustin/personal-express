# My Awesome Project
This website lets you input a quote. Specifically a philosophical quote. If you cannot think of one you can click a button and three quotes will be generated for you. If you don't like the generated quotes feel free to delete them. But your quotes shall be set in stone.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on the storing of data in a database to generate information to the dom later as well as allowing people to post comments. This website was the perfect opportunity to allow me to practice storing preset data then and posting on command of the user as well as posting comments into a section for users to see.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that the index.html keeps your code static. Index.ejs lets you be more dynamic with your coding allowing you to add javascript in your html code and utilize your database.
